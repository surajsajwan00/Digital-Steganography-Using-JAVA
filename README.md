# Digital Steganography Using Java

## Overview

Data security is a critical concern in todayâ€™s digital world. Digital steganography offers a method to safeguard sensitive information by embedding it within digital files such as text and images, without altering the original data. This approach provides enhanced privacy, data integrity, and protection against cyber threats.

## Project Objective

Our project aims to explore and implement steganography techniques to secure user data. By concealing information within ordinary files, including text, images, and handwritten text, we ensure the data remains hidden in plain sight. The application utilizes encryption and steganography algorithms to protect and obscure sensitive information effectively.

## Key Features

- **Text Steganography**: Embedding secret messages within plain text files.
- **Image Steganography**: Hiding data within image files.
- **Handwritten Text Steganography**: Concealing information in handwritten documents.
- **Data Security**: Using encryption and steganography algorithms for enhanced privacy and protection.

This project serves as a tool for users to protect their data by hiding it securely and discreetly.
